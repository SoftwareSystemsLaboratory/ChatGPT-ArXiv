Show how to allocate a dynamic array of floating point numbers in C.

See `memory0.c` in project for Chat-GPT solution.

In C, you can allocate a dynamic array of floating point numbers using the malloc function. Here's an example code that allocates an array of 10 floating point numbers:


In this code, we first define the size of the array to be 10. We then use malloc to allocate enough memory to hold 10 floating point numbers, which is size * sizeof(float) bytes. We cast the return value of malloc to a float * to indicate that the pointer points to an array of floats. We check if malloc returned a null pointer, which indicates that the memory allocation failed.

Once we have the pointer to the allocated memory, we can use array notation to access and modify the elements of the array, just like a regular array. When we're done using the array, we free the memory using the free function to avoid memory leaks.

Note that malloc returns a void pointer (void *) which needs to be cast to the appropriate pointer type (float * in this case) before being used as an array. Also, when using malloc to allocate memory dynamically, it's important to remember to free the memory when you're done using it to avoid memory leaks.
