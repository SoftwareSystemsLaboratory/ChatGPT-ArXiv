The access to arr.data is [still] not safe.s

# Answer

See `memory2.c` in project for Chat-GPT solution.

You're right, accessing arr.data directly as shown in the previous example is not safe because there is no bounds checking to ensure that we are not accessing memory outside the allocated block. To make the access to arr.data safe, we can define accessor functions that include bounds checking.

Here's an example code that creates a safe or wrapped pointer for a dynamic array of floating point numbers with accessor functions:

In this code, we define two accessor functions getFloatArrayValue and setFloatArrayValue to get and set the values of the array, respectively. These functions take an index and check if the index is within the bounds of the array (between 0 and arr.size - 1). If the index is out of bounds, the function prints an error message and exits the program with an error code.

In the main function, we create a FloatArray using createFloatArray, and check if the size of the array is not 0 (which indicates that the memory allocation was successful). We then use the accessor functions setFloatArrayValue and getFloatArrayValue to access and modify the elements of the array, respectively. When we're done using the array, we free the memory using destroyFloatArray to ensure that the memory is properly deallocated, even if an error occurs during the program's execution.

By using accessor functions like this, we can ensure that the access to arr.data is safe and bounds-checked, which helps prevent memory errors and bugs in our program.
